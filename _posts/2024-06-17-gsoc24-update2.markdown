#### People of the Internet,

While working on keystroke events, I realized my improvements to the event.change property were still inconsistent for certain Unicode characters. This led me to delve into code units, code points, graphemes, and other cool Unicode concepts. I found [this blog post](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/) to be very enlightening.

Here's an update on my progress over the past two weeks:

### MRs merged:
- **event.change** : The change property of the event object now correctly handles Unicode, with adjustments to selStart and selEnd calculations. [!MR998](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/okular/-/merge_requests/998)
- **cursor position and undo/redo fix** : Fixed cursor position calculations to account for rejected input text and resolved merging issues with undo/redo commands in text fields. [!MR1011](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/okular/-/merge_requests/1011)
- **DocOpen Event implementation** : Enabled document-level scripts to access the event object by implementing the DocOpen event. [!MR1003](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/okular/-/merge_requests/1003)
- **Executing validation events correctly** : Fixed a bug where validation scripts wouldn't run after KeystrokeCommit scripts in Okular. [!MR999](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/okular/-/merge_requests/999)
- **Widget refresh functions for RadioButton, ListEdit and ComboEdit** : Added refresh functions as slots for RadioButton, ListEdit, and ComboEdit widgets, aiding in reset functionality and script updates. [!MR1012](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/okular/-/merge_requests/1012)
- **Additional document actions in Poppler** : Implemented reading additional document actions (CloseDocument, SaveDocumentStart, SaveDocumentFinish, PrintDocumentStart, PrintDocumentFinish) in the qt5 and qt6 frontends for Poppler. [!MR1561 (in Poppler)](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/merge_requests/1561)

### MRs currently under review:
- **Reset form implementation in qt6 frontend for Okular** : Working on the reset form functionality in Okular, currently focusing on qt6 frontend details. [!MR1564 (in Poppler)](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/poppler/poppler/-/merge_requests/1564)
- **Reset form in Okular** : Using the Poppler API to reset forms within Okular. [!MR1007](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/okular/-/merge_requests/1007)
- **Fixing order of execution of events for text form fields** : Addressing the incorrect execution order of certain events (e.g., calculation scripts) and ensuring keystroke commit, validation, and format scripts are evaluated correctly when setting fields via JavaScript.  [!MR1002](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/okular/-/merge_requests/1002)

For the coming weeks, my focus will be on implementing reset forms, enhancing keystroking and formatting scripts, and possibly starting on submit forms. Let's see how it goes.

See you next time. Cheers!
